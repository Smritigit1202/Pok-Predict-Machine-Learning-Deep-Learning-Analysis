# Pok√©mon Prediction - Machine Learning & Deep Learning Analysis

This project applies multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models on the Pok√©mon dataset to predict Pok√©mon types, legendary status, stats, and more.  
Each ML/DL model is implemented in a separate Python file for clarity.

## üõ† Preprocessing Notes
- Categorical columns are Label Encoded.
- Features are Standard Scaled for models that require scaling.

## üìå Future Improvements
- Add hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Compare all models in a single script
- Save trained models using joblib or pickle
